## 📚 What I Learned

This course provided an in-depth exploration of English grammar structures related to **question formation**, **progressive actions**, and **future expressions**.  
Through structured lessons and practice exercises, I learned to:

- Form and answer **information questions** and **yes/no questions** using “BE” and auxiliary verbs.  
- Distinguish between **countable and uncountable nouns**, and correctly use “how much” and “how many.”  
- Construct **present progressive** sentences to describe actions happening now.  
- Build **negative** and **interrogative** forms in the present progressive tense.  
- Compare **simple present** vs **present progressive** to express habits versus ongoing actions.  
- Express **future actions** using “BE going to” and **present progressive as future**.  
- Use **can** and **can’t** to describe abilities and permissions.  
- Apply all learned concepts through contextual practice exercises in each module.

These lessons helped improve my fluency and confidence in expressing time-related actions and forming grammatically correct questions and responses.
