## 📚 What I Learned

This course strengthened my foundation in English grammar and sentence formation using the **simple present tense**.  
Through interactive lessons and exercises, I learned to:

- Understand the use of the **BE verb (am, is, are)** in affirmative, negative, and question sentences.  
- Form **simple present tense sentences** with regular and irregular verbs.  
- Construct **negative statements** using “do not” and “does not.”  
- Build **yes/no questions** using the BE verb.  
- Recognize and use **word forms** (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) to create clear and accurate sentences.  
- Improve grammar accuracy through guided practice in every module.

These lessons helped me gain more confidence in using present tense grammar to describe facts, routines, and general truths clearly and correctly.
