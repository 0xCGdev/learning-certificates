## 📚 What I Learned

This course deepened my understanding of English verb tenses by focusing on **past-time actions**, their forms, and usage.  
Through guided lessons and exercises, I learned to:

- Use **regular and irregular verbs** correctly in the simple past.  
- Form **affirmative, negative, and question sentences** with *BE* and other verbs.  
- Recognize and use **object pronouns** accurately.  
- Ask and answer **simple past information and yes/no questions**.  
- Apply **comparatives** and **demonstratives** (*this, that, these, those*) to describe and compare situations.  
- Use **infinitive structures** with verbs like *want, need, and like* to express preferences and intentions.  
- Strengthen overall grammar accuracy through multiple practice exercises in each module.

These lessons helped me build a stronger foundation for expressing and describing past experiences in English communication.
